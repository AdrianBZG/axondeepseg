[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/neuropoly/axondeepseg/master?filepath=notebooks%2Fgetting_started.ipynb)

Segment axon and myelin from microscopy data using Deep Learning techniques. Written in Python.
Methods based on deep convolutional neural networks.
The U-Net from ([Ronneberger et al.](https://arxiv.org/abs/1505.04597)) is used as a pixel classifier model.
