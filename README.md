# AxonDeepSeg : Axon Deep Segmentation Toolbox

Segment axon and myelin from microscopy data using Deep Learning techniques. Written in Python.
Methods based on deep convolutional neural networks.
The U-Net from ([Ronneberger et al.](https://arxiv.org/abs/1505.04597)) is used as a pixel classifier model.
