Introduction
===============================================================================
AxonDeepSeg is an open-source software using deep learning and aiming at automatically segmenting axons and myelin
sheaths from microscopy images.

AxonDeepSeg was developed by NeuroPoly, the neuroimagery laboratory of Polytechnique Montr√©al.

Installation
===============================================================================
The following lines will help you install all you need to ensure that AxonDeepSeg is working. Test data and
instructions are provided to help you use AxonDeepSeg.

.. note:: AxonDeepSeg is not compatible with Windows due to third-party dependencies.
          AxonDeepSeg was tested with Mac OS and Linux.

Python
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

First, you should make sure that Python 2.7 is installed on your computer. Run the following command in the terminal::

    python -V

The version of python should be displayed in the terminal. If not, you have to install Python 2.7 on your computer.
To do that, you can follow the instructions given on
`the official python wiki <https://wiki.python.org/moin/BeginnersGuide/Download>`_.

Virtualenv
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
`Virtualenv` is a Python package that allows you to create virtual environments where
you can sandbox environments with different package versions without affecting
your system packages. If you don't have it installed, please follow the instructions
from the `virtualenv website <https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/>`_.

Before installing AxonDeepSeg, we will need to set up a virtual environment.
A virtual environment is a tool that lets you install specific versions of the python modules you want.
It will allow AxonDeepSeg to run with respect to its module requirements,
without affecting the rest of your python installation.

First, navigate to your home directory::

    cd ~

We will now create a virtual environment. For clarity, we will name it ads_venv::

    virtualenv ads_venv

To activate it, run the following command::

    source ads_venv/bin/activate

If you performed all the steps correctly, your username in the console should now be preceded by the name of your
virtual environment between parenthesis, like this::

    (ads_venv) username@hostname /home/...

    git pull
    pip install -e .

Testing the installation
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In order to test the installation, you can launch an integrity test by running the following command on the terminal (make sure your virtual env is activated before, as explained in the `Creation a virtual environment <https://neuropoly.github.io/axondeepseg/documentation.html#creating-a-virtual-environment>`_ section)::

    axondeepseg_test


This integrity test automatically performs the axon and myelin segmentation of a test sample. If the test succeeds, the following message will appear in the terminal, meaning that the software was correctly installed::

    * * * Integrity test passed. AxonDeepSeg is correctly installed. * * * 

Models
===============================================================================

Existing models
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Two models are available and shipped together with the installation package, so you don't need to install them separately.
The two models are described below:

* A SEM model, that works at a resolution of 0.1 micrometer per pixel.
* A TEM model, that works at a resolution of 0.01 micrometer per pixel.

Getting started
===============================================================================

We provide a simple `Jupyter notebook <https://github.com/neuropoly/axondeepseg/blob/master/notebooks/getting_started.ipynb>`_ which explains how to use AxonDeepSeg for segmenting axons and myelin. You can directly launch it by using the `Binder link <https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/neuropoly/axondeepseg/master?filepath=notebooks%2Fgetting_started.ipynb>`_.

Example dataset
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

You can test AxonDeepSeg by downloading the test data available
`here <https://osf.io/rtbwc/download>`_.

Syntax
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The script to launch is called **axondeepseg**. It takes several arguments:

* Required arguments:
  **-t** {SEM,TEM} OR **--type** {SEM,TEM}: Type of acquisition to segment. SEM: scanning electron microscopy samples. TEM: transmission electron microscopy samples. 
  **-i** IMGPATH [IMGPATH ...] OR **--imgpath** IMGPATH [IMGPATH ...]: Path to the image to segment or path to the folder where the image(s) to segment is/are located.

* Optional arguments:
  **-m** MODEL OR **--model** MODEL: Folder where the model is located. The default SEM model path is **default_SEM_model_v1**. The default TEM model path is **default_TEM_model_v1**.
  **-s** SIZEPIXEL OR **--sizepixel** SIZEPIXEL: Pixel size of the image(s) to segment, in micrometers. If no pixel size is specified, a **pixel_size_in_micrometer.txt** file needs to be added to the image folder path. The pixel size in that file will be used for the segmentation.
  **-v** {0,1,2,3} OR **--verbose** {0,1,2,3}: Verbosity level. 
                        0 (default) : Displays the progress bar for the segmentation. 
                        1: Also displays the path of the image(s) being segmented. 
                        2: Also displays the information about the prediction step for the segmentation of current sample. 
                        3: Also displays the patch number being processed in the current sample.
  **-o** OVERLAP OR **--overlap** OVERLAP: Overlap value (in pixels) of the patches when doing the segmentation. Higher values of overlap can improve the segmentation at patch borders, but also increase the segmentation time. Default value: 25. Recommended range of values: [10-100]. 

.. NOTE ::
   You can get the detailed description of all the arguments of the **axondeepseg** command at any time by using the following call:
   ::
    axondeepseg -h



















.. WARNING ::
   The current models available for segmentation are trained for patches of 512x512 pixels. This means that your input image(s) should be at least 512x512 pixels in size **after the resampling to the target pixel size of the model you are using to segment**. 

   For instance, the TEM model currently available has a target resolution of 0.01 micrometers per pixel, which means that the minimum size of the input image (in micrometers) is 5.12x5.12.

   **Option:** If your image to segment is too small, you can use padding to artificially increase its size (i.e. add empty pixels around the borders).


Segment a single image
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* The image file *image.png* is the image to segment.
* The file *pixel_size_in_micrometer.txt* contains a single float number corresponding
to the resolution of the image, that is the **size of a pixel in micrometer**.

Once you have downloaded the test data, go to the extracted test data folder. In our case::

    cd test_segmentation






To segment a single microscopy image, specify the path to the image to segment in the **-i** argument. For instance, to segment the SEM image '77.png' of the test dataset, that has a pixel size of 0.07 micrometers, use the following command::

    axondeepseg -t SEM -i test_sem_image/image1_sem/77.png -v 2 -s 0.07

The script will use the explicitely specified size argument (here, 0.07) for the segmentation. If no pixel size is provided in the arguments, it will automatically read the image resolution encoded in the file: *pixel_size_in_micrometer.txt* if that file exists in the folder containing the image to segment.
The segmented acquisition itself will be saved in the same folder as the acquisition image, with the suffix '_seg-axonmyelin.png', in png format, along with the binary axon and myelin segmentation masks (with the suffixes '_seg-axon.png' and '_seg-myelin.png'). In our example, the three output files will be generated: '77_seg-axonmyelin.png', '77_seg-axon.png' and '77_seg-myelin.png'.



Segment multiple images
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To segment a multiple microscopy images of same resolution that are located in the same folder, specify the path to the folder in the **-i** argument. For instance, to segment the images in folder 'test_sem_image/image 1_sem/' of the test dataset, that has a pixel size of 0.07 micrometers, use the following command::

    axondeepseg -t SEM -i test_sem_image/image 1_sem/ -v 2 -s 0.07





* To segment multiple images acquired with the same resolution, put them all in the same folder and
launch the segmentation of this folder, like below::

    axondeepseg -t SEM -i test_sem_image/image 1_sem/







The images you want to segment must be stored following a particular architecture::

    images_to_segment/
    --folder_1/
    ---- your_image_1.png
    ---- another_image.png
    ---- ...
    ---- pixel_size_in_micrometer.txt (*)
    ...


* The image file *image.png* is the image to segment.
* The file *pixel_size_in_micrometer.txt* contains a single float number corresponding
to the resolution of the image, that is the **size of a pixel in micrometer**.

.. NOTE ::
   You can also specify the pixel size as an argument to our software.

Once you have downloaded the test data, go to the extracted test data folder. In our case::

    cd test_segmentation

The script to launch is called **axondeepseg**. It takes several arguments:

* **t**: type of the image. SEM or TEM.
* **i**: path to the image.
* **s**: (optional) resolution (size in micrometer of a pixel) of the image.
* **v**: (optional) verbosity level. Default 0.

    * 0 displays only a progress bar indicating the advancement of the segmentations.
    * 1 displays additionally the path of the image that was just segmented.
    * 2 displays additionally information about the current step of the segmentation of the current image.

To segment one of the image that we downloaded (here, a SEM image), run the following command::

    axondeepseg -t SEM -i test_sem_image/image1_sem/77.png -v 2 -s 0.07

The script will use the size argument (here, 0.07) for the segmentation. If no size is provided in the arguments,
it will automatically read the image resolution encoded in the file: *pixel_size_in_micrometer.txt*
The different steps will be displayed in the terminal thanks to the verbosity level set to 2.
The segmented acquisition itself will be saved in the same folder as the acquisition image,
with the suffix 'segmented_', in png format.


* To segment multiple images acquired with the same resolution, put them all in the same folder and
launch the segmentation of this folder, like below::

    axondeepseg -t SEM -i test_sem_image/image 1_sem/


* To segment multiple images acquired with different resolutions,
please use the folder structure explained in `Data <https://neuropoly.github.io/axondeepseg/documentation.html#data>`_,
i.e., put all image with the same resolution in the same folder.
* Then, segment each folder one after the other using the argument **-s** or segment all folders in one command
by specifying multiple paths to segment and using a different pixel_size_in_micrometer.txt for each folder, like this::

    axondeepseg -t SEM -i test_sem_image/image1_sem test_sem_image/image2_sem/


Here, we segment all images located in image1_sem and image2_sem that don't have the "segmented" suffix.

Each output segmentation will be saved in the corresponding sub-folder.














Jupyter notebooks
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Here is a list of useful Jupyter notebooks available with AxonDeepSeg:

* `performance_metrics.ipynb <https://github.com/neuropoly/axondeepseg/blob/master/notebooks/performance_metrics.ipynb>`_: Notebook that computes a large set of segmentation metrics to assess the axon and myelin segmentation quality of a given sample (compared against a ground truth mask). Metrics include sensitivity, specificity, precision, accuracy, Dice, Jaccard, F1 score, Hausdorff distance.

* `noise_simulation.ipynb <https://github.com/neuropoly/axondeepseg/blob/master/notebooks/noise_simulation.ipynb>`_: Notebook that simulates various noise/brightness/contrast effects on a given microscopy image in order to assess the robustness of AxonDeepSeg.

* `morphometrics_extraction.ipynb <https://github.com/neuropoly/axondeepseg/blob/master/notebooks/morphometrics_extraction.ipynb>`_: Notebook that shows how to extract morphometrics from a sample segmented with AxonDeepSeg. The user can extract and save morphometrics for each axon (diameter, solidity, ellipticity, centroid, ...), estimate aggregate morphometrics of the sample from the axon/myelin segmentation (g-ratio, AVF, MVF, myelin thickness, axon density, ...), and generate overlays of axon/myelin segmentation masks, colocoded for axon diameter.

.. NOTE ::
    If it is the first time, install the Jupyter notebook package in the terminal::

        pip install jupyter

    Then, go to the notebooks/ subfolder of AxonDeepSeg and launch a particular notebook as follows::

        cd notebooks
        jupyter notebook name_of_the_notebook.ipynb 

Help
===============================================================================

If you experience issues during installation and/or use of AxonDeepSeg, you can post a new issue on the `AxonDeepSeg GitHub issues webpage <https://github.com/neuropoly/axondeepseg/issues>`_. We will reply to you as soon as possible.

Manual correction
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If the segmentation with AxonDeepSeg fails or does not give optimal results, you can try one of the following options:

**Option 1: manual correction of the segmentation masks**

* Note that when you launch a segmentation, in the folder output, you will also find the axon and myelin masks (separately), named 'axon_mask.png' and 'myelin_mask.png'. If the segmentation proposed by AxonDeepSeg is not optimal, you can manually correct the myelin mask.
* For example, you can open the microscopy image and the myelin mask with an external tool/software (such as GIMP: https://www.gimp.org/). For a more detailed procedure, you can visit https://www.gimp.org/tutorials/Layer_Masks/.
* After correcting the myelin mask, you can regenerate the image (axon+myelin). To do this, you can use the following notebook: https://github.com/neuropoly/axondeepseg/blob/master/notebooks/generate_axons_from_myelin.ipynb.

**Option 2: manual correction combined with AxonSeg software**

* Manually correct the axon mask (as explained in Option 1).
* Use the `AxonSeg <https://github.com/neuropoly/axonseg>`_ software to segment the myelin from the axon mask. In order to do this, install AxonSeg, and then follow the instructions in part 5 of the `as_tutorial guideline <https://github.com/neuropoly/axonseg/blob/master/as_tutorial.m>`_.
